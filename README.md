The Softball Statistics project is a comprehensive project designed to analyze and improve the batting performance of softball players through detailed statistical tracking and visualization. This project features a user-friendly interface that displays player stats in a clear, well-organized table format. Players’ performance data is manually inputted into the system, with plans to implement a more dynamic input feature to eliminate the need for front-end or back-end access via Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.  

The front end, built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, provides a visually appealing and intuitive GUI for CRUD operations, enabling users to query, create, update, and delete player stats. The back end, powered by .NET 8 and Entity Framework Core, integrates with a MySQL database, where player data is securely stored and managed. Swagger UI is used for testing back-end operations during development.  

One of the project’s standout features is the ability to upload and display videos of players' swings. These videos include playback controls, such as play, pause, rewind, and fullscreen options, allowing users to analyze swings in detail. Additionally, the project team is working on implementing graphs to track players' scores over time, providing a clear visual representation of progress across multiple games.  

Sample data from a local softball team has been used to test the system, and the feedback has highlighted the clarity and ease of use of the interface. While challenges, such as implementing multi-game data tracking and resolving CORS issues, remain, the team continues to adapt and refine the project.  

This project combines front-end and back-end technologies with a focus on delivering a valuable tool for softball teams and coaches, showcasing the team’s ability to innovate and overcome technical obstacles in software development.
